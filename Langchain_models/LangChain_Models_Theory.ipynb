        "# LangChain Models\n",
        "\n",
        "LangChain provides a standardized interface for interacting with different types of models used in natural language processing and reasoning tasks. Models are the fundamental building blocks in LangChain, as they power the generation, understanding, and transformation of text and other data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Types of Models in LangChain\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **LLMs (Large Language Models)**  \n",
        "   - These are text-in, text-out models such as GPT, LLaMA, or Claude.  \n",
        "   - They are primarily used for text generation tasks such as answering questions, summarization, and creative writing.  \n",
        "   - Example: Using an OpenAI GPT model through LangChain’s LLM wrapper.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Add blockquote\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Chat Models**  \n",
        "   - These are conversational models that take structured messages as input and return structured outputs.  \n",
        "   - They provide more flexibility than LLMs by preserving the role (system, user, assistant) for better conversational flow.  \n",
        "   - Example: ChatGPT is implemented as a chat model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Text Embedding Models**  \n",
        "   - These convert text into high-dimensional numerical vectors.  \n",
        "   - Embeddings capture semantic meaning, making them useful for tasks like similarity search, clustering, and retrieval.  \n",
        "   - Example: Using OpenAI’s embedding models for vector databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Output Parsers**  \n",
        "   - Although not models in themselves, output parsers are closely tied to models.  \n",
        "   - They help transform the raw output of models into structured formats (JSON, lists, numbers).  \n",
        "   - Useful in scenarios where predictable output is required.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Custom Models**  \n",
        "   - LangChain allows integration with custom or local models.  \n",
        "   - Developers can wrap APIs, fine-tuned models, or even open-source models in a LangChain-compatible interface.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of LangChain Models\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Unified API:** Provides a consistent interface across different model providers (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, etc.).  \n",
        "- **Flexibility:** Supports both hosted (cloud-based) and local models.  \n",
        "- **Integration:** Can be combined with prompts, chains, memory, and agents to build complex applications.  \n",
        "- **Modularity:** Models are easily swappable, allowing developers to experiment with different providers without changing the core logic.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Use Cases\n",
        "\n",
        "- Text generation (articles, summaries, creative writing)  \n",
        "- Conversational agents (chatbots, virtual assistants)  \n",
        "- Semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  \n",
        "- Structured output for downstream tasks  \n",
        "- Fine-tuning and experimentation with custom models  \n"
